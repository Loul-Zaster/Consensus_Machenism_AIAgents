The noise you hear when you have tinnitus isn't caused by an external sound, and other people usually can't hear it.\n\nTinnitus is a common problem. It affects about 15% to 20% of people, and is especially common in older adults.\n\nTinnitus is usually caused by an underlying condition, such as age-related hearing loss, an ear injury or a problem with the circulatory system. For many people, tinnitus improves with treatment of the underlying cause or with other treatments that reduce or mask the noise, making tinnitus less noticeable.\n\nSymptoms:\nTinnitus involves the sensation of hearing sound when no external sound is present. Tinnitus symptoms may include these types of phantom noises in your ears:\n- Ringing\n- Buzzing\n- Roaring\n- Clicking\n- Hissing\n- Humming\n\nThe phantom noise may vary in pitch from a low roar to a high squeal, and you may hear it in one or both ears. In some cases, the sound can be so loud it can interfere with your ability to concentrate or hear external sound. Tinnitus may be present all the time, or it may come and go.\n\nWhen to see a doctor:\nSome people aren't very bothered by tinnitus. For other people, tinnitus disrupts their daily lives. If you have tinnitus that bothers you, see your health care provider.\n\nMake an appointment to see your provider if:\n- You develop tinnitus after an upper respiratory infection, such as a cold, and your tinnitus doesn't improve within a week\n- You have tinnitus that occurs suddenly or without an apparent cause\n- You have hearing loss or dizziness with the tinnitus\n\nSee your provider as soon as possible if:\n- You have tinnitus that appears suddenly or without an apparent cause\n- You have hearing loss or dizziness with the tinnitus",

Tinnitus is common, with surveys estimating that 10 to 25% of adults have it. Children can also have tinnitus. For children and adults, tinnitus may improve or even go away over time, but in some cases, it worsens with time. When tinnitus lasts for three months or longer, it is considered chronic.\n\nThe causes of tinnitus are unclear, but most people who have it have some degree of hearing loss. Tinnitus is only rarely associated with a serious medical problem and is usually not severe enough to interfere with daily life. However, some people find that it affects their mood and their ability to sleep or concentrate. In severe cases, tinnitus can lead to anxiety or depression.\n\nCurrently, there is no cure for tinnitus, but there are ways to reduce symptoms. Common approaches include the use of sound therapy devices (including hearing aids), behavioral therapies, and medications.\n\nSymptoms:\nThe symptoms of tinnitus can vary significantly from person to person. You may hear phantom sounds in one ear, in both ears, and in your head. The phantom sound may ring, buzz, roar, whistle, hum, click, hiss, or squeal. The sound may be soft or loud and may be low or high pitched. It may come and go or be present all the time. Sometimes, moving your head, neck, or eyes, or touching certain parts of your body may produce tinnitus symptoms or temporarily change the quality of the perceived sound.\n\nCauses:\nWhile the exact causes of tinnitus are not fully understood, it has been linked to the following:\n- Noise exposure\n- Age-related hearing loss\n- Earwax blockage\n- Ear bone changes\n- Head or neck injuries\n- Medications including some antibiotics, cancer medications, and high doses of aspirin\n\nTreatment:\nWhen tinnitus has an underlying physiological cause, such as earwax or jaw joint problems, addressing the cause can eliminate or greatly reduce symptoms. But for many people, symptoms can persist for months or even years. There are several ways to lessen the impact of tinnitus:\n\n1. Sound therapy: Using external noise to mask or distract from the tinnitus sound. This includes white noise machines, hearing aids, and masking devices.\n\n2. Behavioral therapy: Working with a therapist to change your reaction to tinnitus. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) can help you learn coping techniques.\n\n3. Medication: Some drugs may help reduce the severity of tinnitus or complications. These include tricyclic antidepressants and antianxiety drugs.\n\n4. Lifestyle changes: Stress management, reducing alcohol and caffeine, and getting enough sleep can help manage tinnitus.",
