**Consensus Diagnosis:**
Based on the expert opinions provided, the consensus diagnosis is **Migraine with Aura**. This diagnosis is supported by the patient's symptoms of severe headache, sensitivity to light and sound, nausea, and visual disturbances, as well as their family history of migraine. The presence of aura symptoms, such as seeing spots of light, is a key feature of migraine with aura.

**Consensus Treatment Plan:**
Given the incomplete information provided for treatment recommendations, I will rely on general guidelines for migraine with aura management. The consensus treatment plan includes:

1. **Lifestyle modifications**: Stress management, regular sleep patterns, and avoidance of triggers that may exacerbate migraine symptoms.
2. **Pharmacological treatment**: Prescription of triptans or other migraine-specific medications to alleviate acute migraine attacks. Additionally, preventive medications such as beta blockers, anticonvulsants, or anti-depressants may be considered to reduce the frequency and severity of migraine attacks.
3. **Pain management**: Over-the-counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen may be recommended for mild to moderate migraine attacks.
4. **Follow-up and monitoring**: Regular follow-up appointments to monitor the patient's symptoms, adjust treatment plans as needed, and address any concerns or side effects.

**Explanation of Consensus:**
The consensus diagnosis and treatment plan were reached by analyzing the expert opinions provided. There was a clear agreement among the experts that migraine with aura was the most likely diagnosis, based on the patient's symptoms and medical history. The treatment plan was developed by considering general guidelines for migraine management, as the provided treatment recommendations were incomplete.

**Areas of Agreement and Disagreement:**
The experts agreed on the diagnosis of migraine with aura, but there was some disagreement on the likelihood of other potential diagnoses, such as tension headache and cluster headache. However, the majority of experts considered migraine with aura to be the most likely diagnosis.

**Source Credibility Influence:**
The credibility of the research sources was assessed as highly credible, which increased confidence in the consensus diagnosis and treatment plan. However, the lack of specific treatment recommendations from the experts limited the development of a more detailed and personalized treatment plan.

**Recommendations for Additional Information:**
To strengthen the diagnosis and treatment plan, additional information would be helpful, including:

1. **Complete treatment recommendations**: Detailed treatment recommendations from experts, including specific medications, dosages, and treatment durations.
2. **Patient preferences and values**: Information on the patient's preferences, values, and concerns to develop a more personalized treatment plan.
3. **Medical history and comorbidities**: A comprehensive medical history, including any comorbidities or underlying health conditions that may impact treatment selection.
4. **Response to previous treatments**: Information on the patient's response to previous treatments, including any side effects or efficacy, to inform future treatment decisions.

By gathering this additional information, a more comprehensive and patient-centered diagnosis and treatment plan can be developed, taking into account the unique needs and circumstances of the patient.
